## üí° Project Summary

The project was developed to automate the reporting and forecasting process for a healthcare call center. Using historical call log data, we built dynamic dashboards and applied time-series models to predict call volumes for the upcoming 30 business days. The system helps identify peak call hours, monitor agent-level KPIs, and track appointment trends, all within a user-friendly, interactive dashboard.

## üîç Key Components

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Identified trends in call volumes, agent activity patterns, and appointment booking behavior. Included heatmaps, leaderboards, and call segmentation visuals.

- **Forecasting Models**  
  Implemented ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet models to predict call volumes and identify busy days. SARIMA delivered the most accurate results based on RMSE and MAE.

- **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**  
  Provided two distinct views:  
  - **Client View**: Overview of trends, appointment distribution, and top reasons for calling  
  - **Agent View**: Agent leaderboard, consistency heatmap, and performance flags  

- **Business Insights**  
  Supported workforce planning, call load management, and KPI-driven decision-making through an automated, real-time analytics interface.
